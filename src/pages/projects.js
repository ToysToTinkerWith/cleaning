                        DataGnome is the next generation of plant monitoring. The business produces smart plant sensors, that not only monitors plant health, but also helps the grower understand the cause of any problems the plants might be having. The sensors use data from the plant itself, and data from its environment, to help you diagnose whatever is wrong, and give the most effective tips for improving the plantsâ€™ health. DataGnome is a great fit for any gardeners, growers, and farmers, who want to create a better enviornment for their plants, and improve their yields cycle after cycle.
