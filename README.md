# Bergquist Applications

Bergquist Applications is about expanding the Algorand Defi Economy. 

In this repository is a "get started" package, designed to make it easy for beginner developers to jump into building web applications on the Algorand blockchain. Using modern web develpment frameworks, we can bypass a lot of the initial struggles web developers go through when trying to build web applications, and at the same time provide an an intuitive environment for developing and deploying smart contracts. In teaching others about blockchain development, and learning from students and crypto minds alike, Bergquist Applications hopes to produce better and better blockchain applications in time to come.

Any prior knowledge of crypto and software development
